# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It showcases my profile, skills, projects, and (optionally) blog posts.

The goal of this project is to stay **simple, fast, and maintainable**, while clearly presenting who I am and what I build.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Profile section** – personal information, skills, and background
- **Projects section** – curated list of personal and professional projects
- **Blog (optional)** – technical notes, learnings, or experiments
- **Light/Dark theme** using CSS variables
- **Minimal JavaScript** (Astro-first approach)
- **Responsive & accessible** by default

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Astro** – static-first framework with island architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling for layout and spacing
- **CSS Variables** – custom theme tokens (light/dark mode)
- **Docker** – consistent local and production environments

---

## 🎨 Styling Approach

This project intentionally avoids heavy UI libraries.

- Global design tokens are defined using **CSS variables**
- Layout and spacing are handled with **Tailwind utilities**
- Components are kept small and reusable using Astro

This keeps the codebase:

- easy to reason about
- fast to load
- flexible to evolve
